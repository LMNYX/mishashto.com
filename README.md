# New mishashto website

Completely static website, that implements dynamic pages, through fetch functionality.

## Run locally

```bash
$ python3 serve_locally.py
```

### Limitations

1. Pages can not implement JavaScript, you have to add preload-script, implementation, like on <a target="_blank" href="https://uwu.so">uwu.so</a>.
